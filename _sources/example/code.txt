# Example codes

This section illustrates ways of describing layout generator codes
efficiently. While other examples focus on describing the generation
flow with specific circuit examples (and codes might be outdated),
examples in this section are written in the with the newest APIs and
coding styles, in order to help users to build their codes in the
most effective way. Codes will be kept updated, as new features and
codes added.

## Code example 1: simple elements using primitive templates
This example is about making basic functional elements (i.e. logic gates,
amplifiers) using primitive templates.

## Code example 2: block level placement and routes
This example is about making a block in higher level, composed of basic
elements described in the example 1 (i.e. register files, ADC samplers).

## Code example 3: top / semi-top level integration
This example is about making a top / semi-top level block using functional
blocks, such as SARADC or DFE).
